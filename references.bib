  abstract = {Using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) is a novel way of environmental sensing and human activity recognition (HAR). These methods can be used for several safety and security applications by (re)using Wi-Fi routers without the need for additional costly hardware required for vision-based approaches, known also to be particularly privacy-intrusive. This work introduces a full pipeline of a Wi-Fi CSI-based system for human activity recognition that assesses and compares two deep learning methods. We analyze how different hardware configurations affect WiFi CSI signals. We contribute a novel and more realistic data collection process, in which human activity recognition is seamlessly integrated in real-life, resulting in more reliable assessments of the model classification performance. We analyze how InceptionTime and LSTM-based classification models perform in human activity recognition. The source code and collected dataset are made publicly available for reproducibility and encouraging further research in the community.}

  abstract = {This paper presents an empirical analysis of theperformance of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for identifying objects in real time video feeds. The most popular convolution neural networks for object detection and object category classification from images are Alex Nets, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50. A variety of image data sets are available to test the performance of different types of CNN’s. The commonly found benchmark datasets for evaluating the performance of a convolutional neural network are anImageNet dataset, and CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and MNIST image data sets. This study focuses on analyzing the performance of three popular networks: Alex Net, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50. We have taken three most popular data sets ImageNet, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 for our study, since, testing the performance of a network on a single data set does not reveal its true capability and limitations. It must be noted that videos are not used as a training dataset, they are used as testing datasets. Our analysis shows that GoogLeNet and ResNet50 are able to recognize objects with better precision compared to Alex Net. Moreover, theperformance of trained CNN’s vary substantially across different categories of objects and we, therefore, will discuss the possible reasons for this.}
